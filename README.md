# GentooKernelUpgrade
Bash script which upgrades the kernel on a Gentoo Linux system
Currently Work In Progress!
I would assume if you have Gentoo installed, you know what you're doing and can upgrade a kernel without this script. There is a very slim chance that this breaks anything given that you don't have an exotic configuration. That being said, use at your own risk! More importantly, mount your boot partition!!
